<h4>Many of us were given a common mantra as youngsters, although we may not always remember it on a daily basis. The three "R"s -- reduce, reuse, and recycle -- are the mantra.
</h4><br>

<div class="great"> <h2>REDUCE</h2></div>
<hr>
<p1>
You don't have to worry about subsequent recycling or disposal of waste when you don't create it in the first place.<br>
The idea is to alter your behavior; consider how you may create less trash while you shop, work, and play..<br>
There are several ways you may reduce waste, save time and money, and benefit the environment at the same time.
<br>
Simply reducing the overall amount of waste produced is the first goal of source reduction.<br> 
The second objective is resource conservation by avoiding the use of raw, virgin materials. In other words, if source reduction is followed, less raw materials will be used to make products.
</p1><br>
<div class="great"><h2>RECYCLE</h2></div>
<hr><P2>
Collecting, processing, and selling items made from recycled materials are all part of recycling. A jacket or sleeping bag's filling is created by chipping, melting, and creating fiber from a recycled plastic soda bottle. Recycled content refers to the previously used materials in a new product.<br>
There are lots of things that fall into this category and includes items such as alarm clocks; CD/DVD/Cassette players and game consoles; small kitchen appliances such as kettles, toasters, food mixers and blenders, microwave ovens; personal grooming products like hairdryers, straighteners, curling tongs, electric toothbrushes and shavers; garden tools such as lawnmowers, hedge trimmers and leaf blowers/shredders; other items such as lamps, torches, vacuum cleaners, telephones, mobiles, radios, TV's, printers, camcorders, cameras and smoke alarms.

</P2><br>
<div class="great"><h2>REUSE</h2></div>
<hr><p3>
Reusing anything after cleaning it and reusing the materials is the third and most crucial of the three Rs. Due to the fact that we currently live in a world where most things are disposable, understanding how to reuse goods might be challenging.<br>
The idea of reusing can be used to cut waste in two ways in particular.<br> 
First, instead of buying something that will only be used once and then be thrown away, consider buying something that can be used often.<br>
The second way to reuse is to buy an item secondhand, borrow, or rent an item, instead of buying the new product .<br>
Although the items you reuse may eventually end up being waste, by reusing them you are reducing the overall amount of waste produced by giving the item a second function and expanding the typical lifespan of the item. The process of reusing can also be fun because it gives you the opportunity to take an old or used item and turn it into something new to you.
